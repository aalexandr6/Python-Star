# Python-Newsfeed

## Description

This is a newsfeed application that allows users to view news from various sources. The news is categorized into different categories. A user can also search for news from a specific source.

This is practice project to setup a virtual environment, going over python syntax, using flask to create a web app, using the news api to fetch news and deploy the application to heroku.

# Python 

High level Object oriented programming language. It is Interpreted and runs on a virtual machine. It is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

# Flask 

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

# Sql Alchemy

SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

# Bcrypt

Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

# Pthon-dotenv

python-dotenv reads the key-value pair from .env file and adds them to environment variable. It is great for managing app settings during development and in production using 12-factor principles.

# Gunicorn

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It's a pre-fork worker model ported from Ruby's Unicorn project. The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.
